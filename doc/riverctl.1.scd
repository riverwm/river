RIVERCTL(1) "github.com/ifreund/river" "General Commands Manual"

# NAME

riverctl - command-line interface for controlling river

# SYNOPSIS

*riverctl* [_options_] _command_ [_command specific arguments_]

# DESCRIPTION

*riverctl* is a command-line utility used to control and configure river
over the Wayland protocol.

# OPTIONS

*-help*
	Print a help message and exit.

*-version*
	Print the version number and exit.

# COMMANDS

## ACTIONS

*close*
	Close the focused view.

*csd-filter-add* _app-id_
	Add _app-id_ to the CSD filter list. Views with this _app-id_ are
	told to use client side decoration instead of the default server
	side decoration. Note that this affects both new views, as well as already
	existing ones.

*csd-filter-remove* _app-id_
	Remove an _app-id_ from the CSD filter list. Note that this affects both new
	views, as well as already existing ones.

*exit*
	Exit the compositor, terminating the Wayland session.

*float-filter-add* _app-id_
	Add _app-id_ to the float filter list. Views with this _app-id_
	will start floating. Note that this affects only new views, not already
	existing ones.

*float-filter-remove* _app-id_
	Remove an _app-id_ from the float filter list. Note that this affects only
	new views, not already existing ones.

*focus-output* *next*|*previous*|*up*|*right*|*down*|*left*
	Focus the next or previous output or the closest output in any direction.

*focus-view* *next*|*previous*
	Focus the next or previous view in the stack.

*move* *up*|*down*|*left*|*right* _delta_
	Move the focused view in the specified direction by _delta_ logical
	pixels. The view will be set to floating.

*resize* *horizontal*|*vertical* _delta_
	Resize the focused view along the given axis by _delta_ logical
	pixels. The view will be set to floating.

*snap* *up*|*down*|*left*|*right*
	Snap the focused view to the specified screen edge. The view will
	be set to floating.

*send-to-output* *next*|*previous*|*up*|*right*|*down*|*left*
	Send the focused view to the next or previous output or the closest
	output in any direction.

*spawn* _shell_command_
	Run _shell_command_ using `/bin/sh -c _shell_command_`. Note that
	*spawn* only takes a single argument. To spawn a command taking
	multiple arguments, wrapping the command in quotes is recommended.

*swap* *next*|*previous*
	Swap the focused view with the next/previous visible non-floating
	view. If the first/last view in the stack is focused, wrap.

*toggle-float*
	Toggle the floating state of the focused view.

*toggle-fullscreen*
	Toggle the fullscreen state of the focused view.

*zoom*
	Bump the focused view to the top of the layout stack. If the top
	view in the stack is already focused, bump the second view.

*default-layout* _namespace_
	Set the layout namespace to be used by all outputs by default.

*output-layout* _namespace_
	Set the layout namespace of currently focused output, overriding
	the value set with *default-layout* if any.

*send-layout-cmd* _namespace_ _command_
	Send _command_ to the layout client on the currently focused output
	with the given _namespace_, if any. What commands a layout client
	understands depends on the layout client. For rivertile, see the
	documentation in the *rivertile*(1) man page.

## TAG MANAGEMENT

Tags are similar to workspaces but more flexible. You can assign views multiple
tags and focus multiple tags simultaneously. Bitfields are used to describe
sets of tags when interfacing with river. As such, the following commands
take a normal base 10 number as their argument but the semantics are best
understood in binary. The binary number 000000001 represents a set containing
only tag 1 while 100001101 represents a set containing tags 1, 3, 4, and 9.

When a view spawns it is assigned the currently focused tags of the output.

At least one tag must always be focused and each view must be assigned at
least one tag. Operations that would violate either of these requirements
are ignored by river.

*set-focused-tags* _tags_
	Show views with tags corresponding to the set bits of _tags_ on the
	currently focused output.

*set-view-tags* _tags_
	Assign the currently focused view the tags corresponding to the set
	bits of _tags_.

*toggle-focused-tags* _tags_
	Toggle visibility of views with tags corresponding to the set bits
	of _tags_ on the currently focused output.

*toggle-view-tags* _tags_
	Toggle the tags of the currently focused view corresponding to the
	set bits of _tags_.

*spawn-tagmask* _tagmask_
	Set a _tagmask_ to filter the tags assigned to newly spawned views
	on the focused output. This mask will be applied to the tags of
	new views with a bitwise and. If, for example, the tags 000011111
	are focused on an output with a _tagmask_ of 111110001, a new view
	will be assigned the tags 000010001. If no tags would remain after
	filtering, the _tagmask_ is ignored.

*focus-previous-tags*
	Sets tags to their previous value on the currently focused output,
	allowing jumping back and forth between 2 tag setups.

## MAPPINGS

Mappings are modal in river. Each mapping is associated with a mode and is
only active while in that mode. There are two special modes: "default" and
"locked". The default mode is the initial mode for every seat. The locked
mode is automatically entered while an input inhibitor (such as a lockscreen)
is active. It cannot be left or entered manually.

The following modifiers are available for use in mappings:

	- Shift
	- Lock (Caps lock)
	- Control (Ctrl)
	- Mod1 (Alt)
	- Mod2
	- Mod3
	- Mod4 (Super, Logo, Windows)
	- Mod5
	- None (Create a mapping without modifiers)

Keys are specified by their XKB keysym name. See
_/usr/include/xkbcommon/xkbcommon-keysyms.h_ for the complete list.

Mouse buttons are specified by linux input event code names. The most commonly
used values are:

	- BTN_LEFT - left mouse button
	- BTN_RIGHT - right mouse button
	- BTN_MIDDLE - middle mouse button

A complete list may be found in _/usr/include/linux/input-event-codes.h_

*enter-mode* _name_
	Switch to given mode if it exists.

*map* [_-release_] _mode_ _modifiers_ _key_ _command_
	Run _command_ when _key_ is pressed while _modifiers_ are held down
	and in the specified _mode_.

	- _-release_: if passed activate on key release instead of key press
	- _mode_: name of the mode for which to create the mapping
	- _modifiers_: one or more of the modifiers listed above, separated
	  by a plus sign (+).
	- _key_: an XKB keysym name as described above
	- _command_: any command that may be run with riverctl

*map-pointer* _mode_ _modifiers_ _button_ _action_
	Move or resize views when _button_ and _modifiers_ are held down
	while in the specified _mode_.

	- _mode_: name of the mode for which to create the mapping
	- _modifiers_: one or more of the modifiers listed above, separated
	  by a plus sign (+).

		- move-view
		- resize-view

*unmap* [_-release_] _mode_ _modifiers_ _key_
	Remove the mapping defined by the arguments:

	- _-release_: if passed unmap the key release instead of the key press
	- _mode_: name of the mode for which to remove the mapping
	- _modifiers_: one or more of the modifiers listed above, separated
	  by a plus sign (+).
	- _key_: an XKB keysym name as described above

*unmap-pointer* _mode_ _modifiers_ _button_

## CONFIGURATION

*attach-mode* *top*|*bottom*
	Configure where new views should attach to the view stack.

*background-color* _0xRRGGBB_|_0xRRGGBBAA_
	Set the background color.

*border-color-focused* _0xRRGGBB_|_0xRRGGBBAA_

	  the default.
	- _normal_: Moving the cursor over a view will focus that view.
	  Moving the cursor within a view will not re-focus that view if
	  focus has moved elsewhere.
	- _strict_: Moving the cursor over a view or within a view will
	  focus that view.

	If the view to be focused is on an output that does not have focus,
	focus is switched to that output.

*set-cursor-warp* *disabled*|*on-output-change*
	Set the cursor warp mode. There are two available modes:

	- _disabled_: Cursor will not be warped. This is the default.
	- _on-output-change_: When a different output is focused, the cursor will be
	  warped to its center.

	repeat delay to _delay_ milliseconds.

*xcursor-theme* _theme_name_ [_size_]
	Set the xcursor theme to _theme_name_ and optionally set the _size_.
	The theme of the default seat determines the default for Xwayland
	and is made available through the _XCURSOR_THEME_ and _XCURSOR_SIZE_
	environment variables.
